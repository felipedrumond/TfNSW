## Intro
Thank you for giving me the opportunity to do the assessment.

My main focus with this assessment was to:

* produce a well organised Angular application
* meet all the requirements, including the **Bonus requirements**
* ensure typescript, html and tests code are clean, readable and linted with well named functions and classes
* ensure separation of concerns where possible (given time constraints)
* use best practices where possible (given time constraints)
* demonstrate unit test coverage of the Components, Services and Pipes
* produce a responsive user interface that can adapt itself to different devices screen resolutions both mobile and desktop
